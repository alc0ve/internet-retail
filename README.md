## Installation

I began with cloning a starter code. Then, the node packages were installed using "npm i" (or "npm install"). I had to add columns to the models files and association methods. 


## Usage (Instructions)

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

<!-- in the parentheses is just the relative path to the screenshot-->
